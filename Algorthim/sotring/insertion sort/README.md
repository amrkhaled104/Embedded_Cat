# Insertion Sort Implementation in C

## Overview

This project implements the Insertion Sort algorithm in C. It includes a header file `insertion.h` that declares the function `insertion_sort`, a source file `insertion_sort.c` that defines the function, and a test program in `main.c` that demonstrates the sorting algorithm.

## Files

- **insertion.h**: Header file that contains the declaration of the `insertion_sort` function.
- **insertion_sort.c**: Source file that implements the `insertion_sort` function.
- **main.c**: Test program to demonstrate the functionality of the Insertion Sort algorithm.

## Compilation

To compile the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c insertion_sort.c -o insertion_sort
