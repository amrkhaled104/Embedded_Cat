# Selection Sort Implementation in C

## Overview

This project implements the Selection Sort algorithm in C. It includes a header file `selection.h` that declares the function `selection_sort`, a source file `selection_sort.c` that defines the function, and a test program in `main.c` that demonstrates the sorting algorithm.

## Files

- **selection.h**: Header file that contains the declaration of the `selection_sort` function.
- **selection_sort.c**: Source file that implements the `selection_sort` function.
- **main.c**: Test program to demonstrate the functionality of the selection sort algorithm.

## Compilation

To compile the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c selection_sort.c -o selection_sort
