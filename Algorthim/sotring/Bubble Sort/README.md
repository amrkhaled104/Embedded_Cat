# Bubble Sort Implementation in C

## Overview

This project implements the Bubble Sort algorithm in C. It includes a header file `bubble.h` that declares the function `Bubble_sort`, a source file `bubble_sort.c` that defines the function, and a test program in `main.c` that demonstrates the sorting algorithm.

## Files

- **bubble.h**: Header file that contains the declaration of the `Bubble_sort` function.
- **bubble_sort.c**: Source file that implements the `Bubble_sort` function.
- **main.c**: Test program to demonstrate the functionality of the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Compilation

To compile the program, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc main.c bubble_sort.c -o bubble_sort
